# ATAC-Seq

This repository will serve as a well of information, all regarding the analysis of bulk- and single-cell ATAC-Seq experiments. I will try to include here tools I would like to test, sources of information regarding analysis and everything I can think of related to RNA-Seq.


## [ArchR](https://www.archrproject.com/)

ArchR is a full-featured R package for processing and analyzing single-cell ATAC-seq data. ArchR provides the most extensive suite of scATAC-seq analysis tools of any software available. Additionally, ArchR excels in both speed and resource usage, making it possible to analyze 1 million cells in 8 hours on a MacBook Pro laptop.

it does have some problems being installed in newer infrastructure.


## Avocato

AVOCATO, a snakemake workflow for understanding the relationship between genetic variants and their affected diseases. AVOCATO provides automated identification of disease-relevant cell clusters and fine-mapping of genetics using scATAC-seq data. It also provides a user-friendly dynamic interface for users to interact with scATAC-seq data and all analysis results.

Tool is not public yet, but should be tested.
